Modded using Melonloader and Harmony and confirmed working in the Main and Beta branches (Il2Cpp)

Works best with Mod Manager - Phone App, but settings can be manually configured in /UserData/MelonPreferences.cfg and loaded using LeftCTRL + F4

Bypass the weekly atm limit 10k at a time, or if you're making bank and that will be too tedious, enjoy unlimited laundering at any of your businesses. 
You can also reduce the amount of time it takes to launder, setting to 0 makes it arrive the next time the game updates.

Item duplication works by adding the item to any of your hotbar slots, then with it in your hand press LeftCTRL + LeftALT + Left Shift

This will duplicate your items and respect stack limits, unless you toggle that option off.
With the stack limit set to off, it will increase that item's stack size to the newly duplicated value, allowing you to CTRL+Left Click to store in a single stack. This will persist until you next load the game - so be aware that you will pull multiple stacks on subsequent loads. 

Only works on slots 1-8 as I didn't want to just outright mess with the money slot, but when you can dupe 100 crystals out of nowhere, you'll have more cash than you'll know what to do with in no time.

Hold LeftCtrl and press + (plus) for cash and - (minus) for banked cash. 

Hold Left Control and press R to make NPCs ragdoll - this is for forcing workers to stop blocking your path but works on most other NPCs as well. Have fun with it.

Enable more mix names and optionally the NSFW mix names to create more randomised names for your mixes. Edit "names.json" to add your own (located in Userdata\SeneekiMod)

Easy Pickpocketing - there's still a very small chance of failure - if you fail it just weasn't meant to be. Just enable it and start pickpocketing.

Deal oportunity window is now set to 60 (in-game) mins by default, adjust to your liking (1 being the smallest allowed amount) and sell as often/little as you like to your customers

Changelog:

v1.2.1 Updated Readme

v.1.2.0 Includes easy pickpocketing, more mix names, Shorter deal window and NPC Ragdoll hotkey.

v.1.1.0 Now with money cheat. 

I'm still adding things to this, but it's in a workable state. Throw ideas and suggestions in the comments.
