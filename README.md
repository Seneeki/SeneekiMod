# SeneekiMod
Schedule 1 mod

Enables the following options:

- Bypass ATM weekly deposit limit
- Unlimited laundering
- Custom launder time
- Item duplication
- Increase duped item stack size

Modded using Melonloader and Harmony and confirmed working in the Main and Beta branches (Il2Cpp)

Works best with Mod Manager - Phone App, but settings can be manually configured in /UserData/MelonPreferences.cfg and loaded using LeftCTRL + F4

Bypass the weekly atm limit 10k at a time, or if you're making bank and that will be too tedious, enjoy unlimited laundering at any of your businesses. 
You can also reduce the amount of time it takes to launder, setting to 0 makes it arrive the next time the game updates.

Item duplication works by adding the item to any of your hotbar slots, then with it in your hand press LeftCTRL + LeftALT + Left Shift

This will duplicate your items and respect stack limits, unless you toggle that option off.

With the stack limit set to off, it will increase that item's stack size to the newly duplicated value*, allowing you to CTRL+Left Click to store in a single stack. This will persist until you next load the game - so be aware that you will pull multiple stacks on subsequent loads. 

Only works on slots 1-8 as I didn't want to just outright mess with the money slot, but when you can dupe 100 crystals out of nowhere, you'll have more cash than you'll know what to do with in no time.

I'm still adding things to this, but it's in a workable state. Throw ideas and suggestions in the comments.

* Be reasonable. Going too high will cause the amount to turn into a negative value and you'll either crash the game, corrupt your save or lose the item. And it serves you right, because who needs upwards of 4 million of the same item?
